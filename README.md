# Map Maker  

## Basic information

This repository builds some functions helpful for ploting a regional **basemap** labelled with **coastlines**, **water features**, **Earthquake events** and **seafloor age** information.

 - `MapMaker.ipynb` documents details about each element of the plotted map and provides an example showing how to call these functions and plot the map.

 - `my_functions.py` under `src` folder defines 4 functions used to add the information mentioned above on the map.

 - `test_functions.py` under `tests` folder defines 4 test functions corresponding to each of the 4 my_functions. A user can test my_functions by running `RunTests.ipynb` .

 - Packages used in this map maker project are imported in `dependencies.py`.

Each group member's individual work is stored in a single folder. We complete the `report.md` and `README.md` cooperatively. The records of pulled requests and reviews are shown in [`report.md`](https://github.com/ANU-RSES-Education/EMSC-4033-2022-assignment-Group2/blob/cd9d4b0670d7964abd2104a5868e87a231e48ee5/report/report.md). 

Generally, we went through several steps to make our work as follows:  

1. Create, improve, and fix the necessary functions with informative documentations in `my_functions.py` in each of our directory.  
2. Create `test_functions.py` to test the functions in `my_functions.py`.  
3. Run the test in `RunTests.ipynb`.  
4. Execute `my_functions.py` functions to run `MapMaker.ipynb` successfully.
