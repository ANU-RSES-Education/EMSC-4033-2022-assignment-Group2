## Adding documentation/docstrings

### *Jiarun*

The documentation in `MapMaker.ipynb` is output from **my_documentation()**. This documentation explains the information about each of the elements in the created map, including Basemap, Coastlines and water features, Earthquake point events and Seafloor age, and the packages and methods used to output these elements.   

Docstrings written for each function in `my_functions.py` can be shown by calling **?\<function_name\>**. These docstrings demonstrate necessary information of function returns and arguments and also some important matters needing attention. A calling example is provided under each of function docstrings as well.
